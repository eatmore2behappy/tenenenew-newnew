        <p>to my universe,</p>
        <p>you're the first girl i've ever written a letter to. that alone makes this special—not just for you, but for me too. writing this feels like pouring my heart (pouring my heart?!) onto paper, and i hope every word reaches you the way i intend it to.</p>
        <p>for the past six hundred and eighteen days, even with all the ups and downs, you've meant so, so much to me. you’ve become part of my every day, my thoughts, my prayers, and even in moments of silence—nanatili ka pa rin. thank you for that. and bago ako umalis, gusto ko mag-iwan sayo ng stuff that will remind you of how deeply i've loved you, and how much you’ve shaped the person i am ngayon.</p>
        <p>i know we weren’t always perfect. we had our flaws, our misunderstandings, our missed calls and unsent messages. we both fell short at times, and we even reached a point where we stopped talking completely. (ouch) but somehow, despite everything, we always found our way back to each other. i’m so grateful for that—for every second chance, every late-night conversation, and every little gesture that reminded us of what we had and still have.</p>
        <p>you’ve seen parts of me no one else has. you’ve been there for my best and worst, and you’ve held me even when i didn’t know how to hold myself together. thank you for being patient, for understanding, and for always making me feel like i'm the only girl in the world. i couldn't ask for more &gt;//&lt;</p>
        <p>sa journey natin, countless talaga yung no contact—and i'm sorry na we've let our pride take over at some times :&lt; now, i'm so glad we're trying ulit—with a better version of ourselves. let our distance be the reason para mas maging close tayo sa isa't isa, and let's make bawi for our wounded past. this is just the beginning, and we still have a longgg long way to go. may we spend our time together growing, and learning to love each other all over again.</p>
        <p>i'll always be yours, cai. no distance, no conflicts, no time apart can ever change that. i love youuuu so much, love kooo. mahal kita palagi. &lt;3</p>
